# Welcome to My Mastermind

## Task
In this project I created a game which is the same with mastermind game, but unlike that game this one plays with numbers.

## Description
I created several functions and in this functions I have used while and for loops, strcmp and atoi functions.

## Installation
In macOS and Linux this program will works, unfortunatelly others will install GNU OS, for installing this game.

## Usage
Author or program will generate 4 unique random numbers from 0 to 8, and you must find what are they. If you enter Wrong input as "av54" program will define it and return you Wrong input, if you do not find you go to next round.
```
